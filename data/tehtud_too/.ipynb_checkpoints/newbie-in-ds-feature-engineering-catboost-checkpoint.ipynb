The aim of this notebook is to *predict* the closing price of stocks. The reason of predicting the closing prices is that there is an evidence of large amount of trades are made in last ten minutes before the close of the market. Hence, closing prices can be served as an indicator for traders to evaluate the stocks. \n\n## Work Flow of this notebook \nThere are several thing I would like to achieve in this notebook. The first is a simple elementart data analysis (EDA) of the stock data. There are some features which deserve an attention such as the `imbalance volume`, `ask/bid size`, and `axsk/bid price`, which are the essential features to make an `order book`. Secondly, based on the EDA, the next step is feature engineering, buyt I would say `feature reverse-engineering`. There are lots of notebook availables in the competitions and it's good to `reverse engineer` the mindset of building those features and then try to build by our own. Once features engineering is done, we come to the model selection and training. I have to ideas in my mind: `transformer AE kind RNN` or `XGBoost`. They are the paradigms of time-series forecasting but I prefer XGBoost due to its simplicity. Finally, we will use the test set to make prediction and submit to the organization. To sum up, our work flow is: \n1. Data Preprocessing and Elementary Data Analysis\n2. Features Engineering \n3. Model Selection [`XGBoost`]\n4.
